## Token Factory

A dapp that allows for token issuance & management. The purpose for this at this point in time is to be nerdy & decentralized for MVP. Thus should be able to be run locally & remote or just through contracts.

Contracts & Tests are borrowed from Tokens repo. Using Truffle (with Webpack).  

NOTE: Currently broken (due to Truffle bug) and busy refactoring (UNTESTED).

```npm install```   
```truffle serve```
