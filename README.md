## Token Factory

A dapp that allows for token issuance & management. The purpose for this at this point in time is to be nerdy & decentralized for MVP. Thus should be able to be run locally & remote or just through contracts.

Contracts & Tests are borrowed from Tokens repo. Using Truffle (with Webpack).  
See here on how to install this Truffle: https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle/wiki/Using-Truffle-and-Webpack-(beta).  


```npm install```   
(In here you will need to run "npm run prepublish" in reflux-tx node module to create the lib folder).
```truffle serve```
